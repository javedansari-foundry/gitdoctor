# GitDoctor Configuration - EXPLICIT MODE
# Example configuration for GitDoctor. Copy this file and customize for your environment.
# Fast configuration for searching specific repositories only

# GitLab connection settings
gitlab:
  base_url: "https://gitlab.example.com"
  private_token: "YOUR_GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"
  api_version: "v4"
  verify_ssl: true
  timeout_seconds: 15

# Scan mode configuration
scan:
  # EXPLICIT MODE: Only search the projects listed below
  # Much faster than auto_discover!
  mode: "explicit"

# Explicitly configured projects to search
projects:
  # Option 1: List projects by their full path (RECOMMENDED)
  by_path:
    # Replace these examples with your actual project paths
    # Get paths from: python list_projects.py
    # Or from: results.csv (project_path column)
    # Or from: GitLab web UI URL
    
    # Example format: "group/subgroup/project-name"
    - "your-group/backend/payments-service"
    - "your-group/backend/notifications-service"
    - "your-group/frontend/web-app"
    # Add more projects here...
  
  # Option 2: List projects by their numeric ID (alternative)
  by_id: []
    # - 123
    # - 456

# Groups section (not used in explicit mode)
groups:
  include_subgroups: true
  by_path: []
  by_id: []

# Optional filters (apply even in explicit mode)
filters:
  # Include only these specific paths (whitelist)
  include_project_paths: []
  
  # Exclude specific paths (blacklist)
  exclude_project_paths: []


# ==================== USAGE INSTRUCTIONS ====================
# 
# 1. Find your project paths:
#    python list_projects.py
#    OR
#    Check results.csv from your previous run
#    OR
#    Copy from GitLab web UI URLs
#
# 2. Add project paths above under projects.by_path
#
# 3. Run with this config:
#    gitdoctor -c config-explicit.yaml -i commits.txt -o results.csv -v
#
# 4. SPEED:
#    - 10 projects × 4 commits = ~10-15 seconds
#    - 20 projects × 4 commits = ~20-30 seconds
#    - Much faster than auto-discover mode!
#
# ==================== TIPS ====================
#
# TIP 1: Create different configs for different scenarios
#   - config-production.yaml (only prod repos)
#   - config-backend.yaml (only backend services)
#   - config-critical.yaml (top 5 critical services)
#
# TIP 2: Start with 10-15 most important projects
#
# TIP 3: Use projects.by_path (easier to read than IDs)
#
# TIP 4: Check projects_list.txt for all available projects
