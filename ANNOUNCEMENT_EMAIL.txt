Subject: 🚀 Introducing GitDoctor v1.1 - Automated Release Tracking & Test Selection Tool

Hi Team,

We're excited to announce GitDoctor v1.1, a powerful command-line tool that automates release tracking and intelligent test selection across our GitLab repositories.

🎯 What GitDoctor Does:
• Compare releases and generate complete changelogs in 60 seconds (vs 2-4 hours manually)
• Extract exact changes from Merge Requests for targeted test selection
• Auto-link JIRA tickets from commit messages
• Generate beautiful HTML/CSV reports with visual charts
• 100% accuracy - never miss a commit or repo

💡 Key Use Cases:
• Release Managers: Track what's going to production
• QA Teams: Know exactly what to test and why
• DevOps/PE Teams: Verify deployments and hotfixes
• Developers: Find where commits landed across repos

⚡ Quick Example:
Compare two releases with a single command:

  gitdoctor delta --base MobiquityPay_vX.10.15.8 \
                  --target MobiquityPay_vX.10.16.0 \
                  -o release-delta.html --format html

Output: Complete report with all commits, JIRA tickets, and visual charts in HTML format.
